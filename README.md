# database_design

This is a group assignment. First, your team will function as a consulting company asked to develop a relational database design for a drug store chain and write up a draft report documenting a design along with your reasoning and sample questions and queries. Then, your team will do a revised final design based on feedback from the instructor and TA and implement certain functional requirements in Java using the Spring Boot web server.
